# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction
This project aims to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to gain insights and answer specific research questions. The dataset includes information about individuals with a focus on education, job roles, and salary.

## Objectives
1. Describe the dataset and its features.
2. Perform univariate and bivariate analyses to explore patterns, relationships, and answer research questions.
3. Test a claim regarding salary expectations for specific job roles.
4. Investigate the relationship between gender and specialization.

## Step 1: Import the Data
Import the dataset, display head, shape, and description.

## Step 2: Univariate Analysis
Perform Probability Density Function (PDF) Plots, Histograms, Boxplots, and Countplots for numerical and categorical variables. Find outliers in numerical columns and understand the probability and frequency distribution of each numerical column.

## Step 3: Bivariate Analysis
Discover relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, hexbin plots, and pair plots. Identify patterns between categorical and numerical columns using swarm plots, box plots, and bar plots. Identify relationships between categorical columns using stacked bar plots.

## Step 4: Research Questions
1. Test the claim regarding salary expectations for specific job roles.
2. Explore the relationship between gender and specialization.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Summarize key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Bonus: Interesting Conclusions or Research Questions
If any interesting patterns or additional research questions are discovered, mention them here.
